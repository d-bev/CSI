# CSI: "Code-Scene Investigations"

A webinar hosted by CrowdCast, in which I learned about using Jupyter and Google Colab for data analysis.
(I'd heard a lot of great things about Jupyter so I wanted to learn more about it).

# The Premise

It's the 1920's, and an alcohol smuggler was murdered! A classic "Who done it?" case!

# Here's what we know

Witness Description:

- "A lean male?"
- 30 to 40 years old
- about 150cm tall, maybe a bit taller
- didn't have a car at the crimescene

Detective Report:

- empty firearm magazines left at the scene (weapon was of an illegal model)
- uneven footsteps; boot tracks
